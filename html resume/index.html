    <h3>About</h3> 
    
    At the moment, I am working on my own as a web developer. During my
    job am using Wordpress as a main utility, but also html, css, php, Java
    Script. I am a responsible, detail oriented and hard-working person. I have
    reached a masters degree at Bialystok University of Information
    technologies. I am interested in computer programming languages such as Java
    Script, html, css, php, python, c sharp and java. Moreover, I have a keen
    interest in new technologies such as computers, mobile devices, robots,
    operating systems such as Linux, Android and Windows. I have been traveled
    in seven different countries (Croatia, Bulgaria, Sweden, Greece, Turkey,
    England and Lithuania). I have developed an open mindset and good
    communication skills. In three of these countries (England, Poland and
    Lithuania) I have worked. Fluent in English, Lithuanian, Russian and Polish.
    Moreover, I have big interest in communication and interaction with people.
    Especially with people from different countries and cultures. I like to
    listen them, help these people and solve their various of problems. While I
    have worked in a foreign company “STUDIO MODERNA” as a sales manager I have
    reached VIP clients. At first, while I have started my journey, I had only
    regular clients. My website:
